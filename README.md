# Calculator
## Overview
Developing a Calculator is an excellent way to practice and enhance your understanding of core web development concepts. This project allows you to create a functional and visually appealing calculator capable of performing basic and advanced calculations, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
1. Basic Operations:
   - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)
2. Advanced Operations:
   - Modulo (`%`)
   - Square of a number
3. Functional Buttons:
   - **AC (All Clear):** Clears the current text.
   - **Equal (`=`):** Performs the current calculation.
4. Support for both decimal and whole numbers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Grid layout for styling.
- **Bootstrap**: For additional styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for calculator functionality using event listeners, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

## Folder Structure
```
